This Project heavily relies on [`UE4cfgdumper`](https://github.com/masagrator/UE4cfgdumper) by Masagrator

Why? Well it takes a really long time to configure for both fps and gfx and this will try to reduce that time

To Do:
- [x] Create the usual gfx cheats and their different levels
- [ ] Create FPS codes (_r.Vsync, rhi.SyncInterval, t.MaxFPS, FixedFrameRate, CustomTimeStep_)
- [ ] Option for fps only and gfx only (_and both ofc_)
- [ ] Toggles for cheats before creation of txt
- [ ] Show which one was the default option
- [ ] Preview cheats before downloading
- [x] Scaffold a UI
- [x] Uploading of .txt files
